            `<b className="widgets-title" style="fontSize:18px; color: #AFDDED;">Blockchain at Columbia</b> is Columbia University's organization for distributed ledger technology. B@C nurtures development in the blockchain ecosystem upon a foundation for technical problem-solving. The community fosters relevant academic research through critical analysis of new technologies. The organization’s high standard for knowledge encourages both education on complex subjects and distribution of valuable resources on all related topics.`,
            `B@C has grown into a complex university-wide initiative. Weekly events include technical discussions, academic lectures, and crypto hour discussions for evaluating market trends. Previous larger events include presentations on the Bitcoin network, panels regarding inclusivity of the Blockchain space, and seminars from emerging distributed ledger organizations. B@C has several committees to execute its objectives: Education, Technical Research & Development, Financial Research, Operations, and Public Relations. Each serves a unique purpose and are maintained by a team of Officers and their Committee Leader. The Education Committee, for example, facilitates courses on distributed ledger technology for students and faculty on campus. All Committee Leaders, along with the President and Vice-President, make up the Executive Board of B@C.`,
            `<b className="hero-title"> Students can get involved</b> by attending B@C events and reaching out to Committee Officers. Our large community is open to all and we always welcome new faces.</h5>`
